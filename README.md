## Built with

## What I learned

I've learnt a few things in this particular project:

- I am more familiar with Typescript and how useful it can be
- More aware of folder structure and how Props are passed down through components
- Fetching particular information from an api (I used https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2 for this project) and passing this through the App
